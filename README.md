A Firefox extension for helping with [Hot Topics](http://astrohottopics.wordpress.com/) journal discussion group at University of Toledo.

The extension basically assumes that you want the only page on startup to be astro-ph, and that the openned tabs should be saved in /home/joe/hotter-topics/. WIP
